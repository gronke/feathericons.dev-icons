{/* # The `feather` Icon */}

# Get Started

[Feather](https://github.com/feathericons/feather) is a collection of simply beautiful open source icons. Each icon is designed on a `24 x 24` grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

Feather can easily be used in most environments. Use this website to quickly search and copy icon codes as SVG, React or TypeScript React or use one of the [related projects](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#related-projects).

## Using `feather` With a CDN

To get started with Feather using a CDN, follow these steps:

1. Add `<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>` to `<head>`
2. Add icons using `<i data-feather="{icon-name}"></i>` syntax
3. Call `feather.replace()`

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<i data-feather="circle"></i>
		<script>
			feather.replace()
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

## Using `feather` with NPM

{/* TODO: Add inline image icon here */}
To get started with Feather using [NPM](https://npmjs.com), follow these steps:

1. Add `<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>` to `<head>`
2. Add icons using `<i data-feather="{icon-name}"></i>` syntax
3. Call `feather.icons`

For example:

```sh
npm i feather-icons
```

```js
import feather from "feather-icons"
```

```js
feather.icons.feather.toSvg()
// <svg class="feather feather-feather" ...><line ... /><line ... /></svg>

feather.icons.feather.toSvg({ class: "foo bar", "stroke-width": 1, color: "red" })
// <svg class="feather feather-feather foo bar" stroke-width="1" color="red" ...><line ... /><line ... /></svg>
```

See the [API Reference](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#api-reference) for more information about the available properties and methods of the `feather` object.

## Using `feather` with React

{/* TODO: Add inline image icon here */}
To get started with Feather using [React.js](https://reactjs.org), follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i react-feather`
2. Import using `import { Name } from "react-feather"` syntax
3. Call components using `<Name />` syntax

For example:

```sh
npm i react-feather
```

```tsx
import { Feather } from "react-feather"

export default function App() {
	return (
		<div className="flex h-screen items-center justify-center">
			<div className="flex h-10 items-center gap-2 rounded-2xl bg-sky-500 px-4">
				<Feather className="h-4 w-4 text-white" />
				<div className="text-sm font-semibold tracking-wider text-white">HELLO WORLD</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

## Styling using Classes

Because icons are SVGs, you can add classes like `class="icon-sm"` or `class="icon-lg"` to style them. In your CSS, write rules for the corresponding classes, `.icon-sm` or `.icon-lg`. All icons have a 1:1 aspect ratio, so their `width` and `height` should be the same.

If you use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), you can add `class="w-6 h-6"` for `24px` or `class="w-8 h-8"` for `32px`.

## Styling using Inline Styles

Another trick you can use is `style="width: 1em; height: 1em;"`. This means that an icon will assume the `width` and `height` of the parent element's `font-size`, which by default is `16px`. If the parent element's `font-size` is `32px`, your icon will also appear as `32px`.

You can always extract this pattern as a CSS class so you don't need to repeat yourself.
