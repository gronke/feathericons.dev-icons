# The `feather` Icon

## Get Started

[Feather](TODO) is a collection of simply beautiful open source icons. Each icon is designed on a `24 x 24` grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and flexibility.

Feather can easily be used in most environments. Use this website to quickly search and copy icon codes as SVG, React or TypeScript React or use one of the [related projects](https://github.com/feathericons/feather#related-projects).

## Feather with JavaScript (CDN)

Using a CDN (content delivery network) is the fastest way to start prototyping using Feather.

1. Add `<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>` to `<head>`
2. Add icons using `<i data-feather="{icon-name}"></i>` syntax
3. Add `<script>feather.replace()</script>` to `<body>`

For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/feather-icons"></script>
	</head>
	<body>
		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<i data-feather="circle"></i>
		<i data-feather="square"></i>
		<!-- Step 3 -->
		<script>
			feather.replace()
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

This would draw a [`circle`](/circle) and [`square`](/square) icon.
